#the context
installing manually from downloaded php package is tiring and time-costing
we can do it quicker by using [docker-compose for suitecrm from bitnami](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-suitecrm) 

simply execute [run.sh](./run.sh) to start the instance and [stop.sh](./stop.sh) to turn it off.
